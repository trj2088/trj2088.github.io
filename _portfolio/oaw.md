<h2 style="text-align:center">Project Overview</h2><br/>

This project explores the design and feasibility of an Oblique All-Wing (OAW) supersonic transport aircraft as part of a senior aerospace engineering capstone. The OAW concept combines innovative aerodynamics with structural efficiency to optimize performance across subsonic and supersonic flight regimes. Key features include:

+ Variable Sweep Wing: The aircraft adjusts its wing angle dynamically to minimize drag and improve efficiency across different speeds.
+ Multidisciplinary Approach: A novel design methodology integrates aerodynamics, structural design, and propulsion to create a unified, efficient vehicle.
+ Challenges Addressed: Addressing issues like passenger cabin integration, runway span constraints, and propulsion placement while balancing performance and manufacturability.
+ Applications: The concept demonstrates potential for high-capacity commercial use, military, and surveillance roles, offering superior lift-to-drag ratios compared to traditional designs.
