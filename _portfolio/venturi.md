<h2>Cavitating Venturi</h2><br>

Delivering proper flow rate to a rocket engine is critical to its successful operation. 
As an incompressible fluid enters the venturi throat, its velocity increases and pressure decreases. If this local pressure is reduced below the fluid vapor pressure, small vapor bubbles form. These bubbles will shrink or expand with changes in downstream pressure, maintaining a constant flow rate for fixed inlet conditions (pressure and temperature) and a wide range of outlet pressures. <br> 
<br>
Mass flow rate (for cavitating condition) can be found by:
