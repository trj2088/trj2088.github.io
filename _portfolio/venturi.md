<h3>Why choose a cavitating venturi?</h3>


Delivering the proper propellant flow rate to a rocket engine is critical to its successful operation. A wide range of tools and methods exist to set and maintain the rate of fluid flow in a pipe. The cavitating venturi was chosen for this system 3 main reasons: speed, cost, and simplicity. The response of the venturi is much faster, simpler, and cheaper than any feedback control system within this project budget.<br/>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

As an incompressible fluid enters the venturi throat, its velocity increases and pressure decreases. If this local pressure is reduced below the fluid vapor pressure, small vapor bubbles form. These bubbles will shrink or expand with changes in downstream pressure, maintaining a constant flow rate for fixed inlet conditions (pressure and temperature) and a wide range of outlet pressures. <br>

Mass flow rate (for cavitating condition) can be found by:
